# R scripts used in analysis

1. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMestimation_DroughtMask.R**   Used to estimate thermal safety margins and streaks of thermal danger for each species and occurrence record 
2. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMestimation_WithoutDroughtMask.R**   Same as File 1, but without periods of drought masked out from TSM calculations
3. **VectorThermalSafety_OccurrencePoints.R**   Used to plot maps of occurrence points used in analysis
4. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMsByLatitude.R**   Used to model and plot patterns of thermal safety across latitude
5. **VectorThermalSafety_TSMbiogeography.R**   Used to investigate patterns of thermal safety by biogeographical regions
6. **VectorThermalSafety_GAMpeaks.R**   Used to identify peaks and valleys in thermal safety across latitude
7. **VectorThermalSafety_TimeScales.R** Used to identify the time scales of thermal danger (i.e., the longest stretch of consecutive hours or days with mosquito body temperature > CTmax)
