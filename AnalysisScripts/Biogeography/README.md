# Assignment of vector occurrence records to biomes

We used QGIS to assign vector occurrence records to the WWF 14 biomes (as described in Olson et al. 2001) based on their latitude and longitude.
Specifically we calculated the intersection of the point data layer, uploaded here as "AllSpecies_LatLongs" to the polygon data layer, uploadeded here as "WWF_Biomes" using the vector geoprocessing tool 'Intersection'
